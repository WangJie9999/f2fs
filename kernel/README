Linux kernel
============

This file was moved to Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

Please notice that there are several guides for kernel developers and users.
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

1. Configuration
> make menuconfig
# Options for ZNS+ (File systems >>)
  1) Options for ZNS+ (File systems >>)
    ZNS: Baseline technique
    IZC: This technique uses internal zone compaction scheme.
    HSR: This technique uses hybrid segment recycling scheme.
  2) Copyback-aware Block allocation: This option determines whether the F2FS uses CAB or not.
  3) All cached chunk checking: This option determines whether the F2FS uses IZC-H or not.

2. Compile O/S Kernel
> make;make modules;make modules_install;make install

3. mount f2fs
> ./mount.sh
# If you change the file system size or segment size, you need to modify fdisk.sh and mount.sh.
